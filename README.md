# weather-kin

Automatically updates a [Kindroid](https://kindroid.ai/) AI's **Current Setting** with live weather, so your kin always knows what it's like outside.

Uses [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) — a free weather API that requires no account and no API key.

### Example

> It's currently 12°C and rainy in Seabreak, British Columbia. It's windy outside.

## What you'll need

- A [Kindroid](https://kindroid.ai/) account
- Your **Kindroid API key** (found at the bottom of the general settings tab in Kindroid app)
- Your **kin's AI ID** (found just below the API key)
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A free [Railway](https://railway.com/) account

## Step 1: Fork the repo

1. Go to the [weather-kin GitHub repo](https://github.com/Obiiiiiiiiii/weather-kin).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right.
3. This creates your own copy of the code on GitHub.

---

## Step 2: Find your Kindroid API key and AI ID

1. Open the **Kindroid app** and go to **General** tab.
2. Scroll down to the very bottom to find your **API key** — copy it somewhere safe.
3. Copy your Kin's **AI ID**.

> You'll paste both of these into Railway in the next step.

## Step 3: Find your location's coordinates

1. Go to [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) and search for your kin's location.
2. Right-click the map and click the **coordinates** that appear (this copies them).
3. You'll get something like `49.16, -123.94` — the first number is **latitude**, the second is **longitude**.

## Step 4: Deploy on Railway

1. Go to [railway.com](https://railway.com/) and sign in (or create a free account).
2. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Select your forked **weather-kin** repository.
4. Railway will detect the project automatically. Before it deploys, you need to add your environment variables.

### Add environment variables

Go to your service's **Variables** tab and add the following:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `KINDROID_API_KEY` | `your-api-key` | Your Kindroid API key |
| `KINDROID_AI_ID` | `your-ai-id` | Your kin's AI ID |
| `LOCATION_NAME` | `Seabreak` | The name shown in the weather scene |
| `LATITUDE` | `49.16` | Your location's latitude |
| `LONGITUDE` | `-123.94` | Your location's longitude |
| `TZ` | `America/Vancouver` | Your timezone ([list of timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)) |

**Optional** — these have sensible defaults, but you can override them:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TEMPERATURE_UNIT` | `celsius` | `celsius` or `fahrenheit` |
| `WIND_SPEED_UNIT` | `kmh` | `kmh` or `mph` |
| `UPDATE_HOURS` | `0,6,12,18` | Comma-separated hours (0–23) to update weather |
| `LOCATION_REGION` | `British Columbia` | Region or country can be put here |

Here's what it looks like on Railway:

## Step 5: Deploy

1. Once your variables are saved, click **Deploy** (or Railway may deploy automatically).
2. Check the **Logs** tab — you should see something like:

   ```
   Update schedule: 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, 18:00
   [2026-03-18T06:00:00.000Z] Fetching weather...
   [2026-03-18T06:00:01.234Z] Scene: "It's currently 12°C and rainy in Seabreak."
   [2026-03-18T06:00:01.567Z] Kindroid updated.
   Next update at 12:00 PM (in 360 min)
   ```

3. That's it! Your kin's Current Setting will now update with live weather at the hours you configured.

## Customization tips

- **Want updates every 3 hours?** Set `UPDATE_HOURS` to `0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21`.
- **Want just morning and evening?** Set `UPDATE_HOURS` to `8,20`.
- **Using Fahrenheit and mph?** Set `TEMPERATURE_UNIT=fahrenheit` and `WIND_SPEED_UNIT=mph`.

---

## How it works

1. Fetches current weather from Open-Meteo for your configured coordinates.
2. Converts the WMO weather code, temperature, and wind speed into a natural-language sentence.
3. Pushes that sentence to your kin's Current Setting via the Kindroid API.
4. Waits until the next scheduled hour and repeats.

If a fetch fails, the last successful scene is kept until the next successful update.
